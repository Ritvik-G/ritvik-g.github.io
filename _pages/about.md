I am a Ph.D. student at [**IRT Group, AI Institute**](https://aiisc.cse.sc.edu/) advised by [**Amit Sheth**](https://amit.aiisc.ai/) since July 2024.

My research focuses on bridging **general-purpose** models with **expert-level** intelligence via [Neuro-Symbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-symbolic_AI) approaches. I'm interested in developing ***intelligent***, ***robust*** and ***trustworthy*** AI infrastructure to enable **efficient**, **affordable** and [**Human-Centric**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction) applications.

Beyond academia, I work with industry collaborators to figure out the most efficient and cost-effective ways to optimize their workflows via Neuro-Symbolic methods. Currently, I serve as ***Advisor of Artificial Intelligence*** for [ADT](https://www.adt.com/) since August 2025.
